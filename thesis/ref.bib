	abstract = {The linear attenuation coefficients and buildup factor of MCP-96 alloy were determined for 60Co, 54Mn, and 137Cs gamma emitters and a NaI detector. The thickness of the MCP-96 attenuator was varied from 1 to 4 cm. A collimated beam of gamma rays was allowed to pass through various thicknesses of the MCP-96 alloy. The attenuated beam was detected by a NaI detector, and data were recorded by a multichannel analyzer. The run was repeated without the collimator for broad-beam geometry. For each run, the attenuated beam intensity was normalized by the intensity of the unattenuated incident beam obtained by removing the attenuators. Linear attenuation coefficients were determined by plotting of the intensity of the collimated beam against the attenuator thickness. For every thickness of the alloy, the ratio of the attenuated to the unattenuated beam was found to be higher in broad-beam geometry as compared to the same ratio in narrow-beam geometry. We used the difference in these ratios in broad and narrow-beam geometries to calculate the buildup factor. The buildup factor was found to increase with beam energy and attenuator thickness. Variation in the source-to-detector distance gave a lower value of the buildup factor for a small and a large distance and a higher value for an intermediate distance. The buildup factor was found to be greater than 1 in all cases. We conclude that the buildup factor must be calculated and incorporated for dose correction and precision when the MCP-96 alloy is used for tissue compensation or radiation shielding and protection purposes.},

The calculated broad beam transmission is compared to data derived from literature, presenting good agreement.

	abstract = {High-atomic-number materials may be used as intensity modulating filters for inverse radiation treatment planning with photon beams. Such filters, when placed in a bremsstrahlung beam, attenuate the primary fluence, but also produce scattered photons that will reach the patient. To account for such effects in the optimization of photon beam intensities a semiempirical method based on narrow and broad beam transmission measurements was used to quantify the number of scattered photons produced in these filters. The method was verified by performing analytical calculations based on first scatter and a Monte Carlo simulation in 6 and 18 MV photon beams. The resultant experimental transmission ratios agree with calculations by these methods within 2 per cent under the experimental conditions investigated. The semiempirical method can thus be used as a basis for preliminary decision-making to select the proper material for intensity modulating filters and can provide a fast method to perform independent quality checks of the calculation accuracy of dose planning systems. Change in beam penetration is of less concern when treatments of target volumes at smaller depths are of interest. A 10 g cm-2 thick filter made of low-melting-point alloy produces a change in percentage depth dose of less than 2 per cent for depths larger than 10 cm independent of field size. Similarly the scatter correction modifies the dose distribution by less than 5-10 per cent in most cases.},

The glasses are characterized by lower values of mean free path than standard shield concretes and other glass systems. Thus the selected glasses are established as good gamma shields.

	abstract = {Using photons in therapeutic and diagnostic medicine requires accurate computation of their attenuation coefficients in human tissues. The buildup factor, a multiplicative coefficient quantifying the ratio of scattered to primary photons, measures the degree of violation of the Beer–Lambert law. In this study, the gamma-ray isotropic point source buildup factors, specifically, the energy absorption buildup factor (EABF) and exposure buildup factor, are estimated. The computational methods used include the geometric progression fitting method and simulation using the Geant4 (version 10.4) Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. The buildup factors of 30 human tissues were evaluated in an energy range of 0.015–15 MeV for penetration depths up to 100 mean free paths (mfp). At all penetration depths, it was observed that the EABF seems to be independent of the mfp at a photon energy of 1.5 MeV and also independent of the equivalent atomic number (\$\$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{eq\}\}\$\$) in the photon energy range of 1.5–15 MeV. However, the buildup factors were inversely proportional to \$\$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{eq\}\}\$\$ for energies below 1.5 MeV. Moreover, the Geant4 simulations of the EABF of water were in agreement with the available standard data. (The deviations were less than 5\%.) The buildup factors evaluated in the present study could be useful for controlling human exposure to radiation.},

There is evidence from published clinical data and a suggestion from an analysis of the CHART pilot study data that a dose difference as small as 5\% may lead to real impairment or enhancement of tumour response, as well as altering the risk of morbidity.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare treatment plans for multileaf collimators (MLCs) with different leaf widths and different finite pencil beam (FPB) sizes, to determine the planning quality and delivery efficiency of segmented MLC (SMLC) delivery of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computerized tomography images of 10 right-side MPM patients were used for this planning study on a CORVUS treatment-planning system (NOMOS Corporation, Sewickley, PA) for a Varian Millennium 120-MLC (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Three beam models were used. The first model forced two 0.5-cm MLC leaves to move in tandem to simulate a 1-cm leaf-width MLC and a FPB size of 1 x 1 cm2. The second model used 0.5-cm leaves with a FPB size of 0.5 x 1 cm2 (1 cm in the direction of leaf movement). The third model used 0.5-cm leaves, with a FPB size of 0.5 x 0.5 cm2. For optimization, the same dose constraints and beam parameters were used for each data set. Tissue heterogeneity corrections were used during optimization and dose calculation. Plans were optimized such that the clinical target volume received 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose distributions to the target and normal structures were evaluated. The number of monitor units, the number of segments, and delivery times were used to evaluate delivery efficiency.
RESULTS: All three beam models could be used for IMRT planning for MPM. The doses to clinical target volume, spinal cord, lung, liver, heart, and contralateral kidney were acceptable with all three beam models. The 0.5 x 0.5-cm2 beam model used the most monitor units (6883 +/- 974 vs. 3332 +/- 406 and 3407 +/- 443 for the 1 x 1-cm2 and 0.5 x 1-cm2 models, respectively) and treated the most segments (4297 +/- 802 vs. 1357 +/- 156 and 1767 +/- 212 for the 1 x 1-cm2 and 0.5 x 1-cm2 models, respectively). The plan generated with the 1 x 1-cm2 model required the least amount of time to deliver.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the MPM IMRT plans generated with the three beam models presented here was similar; however, the 1 x 1-cm2 model provided the most efficient delivery of MPM IMRT with the CORVUS planning system.},
